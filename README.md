#### add_mesh_lowpoly_rock.py

A low poly rock generator addon created by [Bombaba](https://github.com/Bombaba). The modified script was heavily based on [this version of the script](https://github.com/Bombaba/BlenderPythonScripts/blob/639ebcf1191c39f5666f64cc525c9ee87c78ed84/add_mesh_lowpoly_rock.py). The script was converted for Blender 2.8, keeping the same functionality as the original.
